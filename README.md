Key Features
Dynamic Movement: Players can move between 1 to 5 meters during each "Green Light" phase.
Timer: A countdown timer ensures players finish within 30 seconds.
User Input: Players decide whether to move or stay still during each phase.
Win/Loss Conditions: Players must avoid moving during "Red Light" and complete the race within the given time.
How It Works
The game randomly announces "Red Light" or "Green Light."
Players decide whether to move (input yes or no).
If the player moves during "Red Light," they're eliminated.
If the player doesn't reach the safe zone within the time limit, they lose.
This version includes better gameplay, additional checks, and dynamic feedback, making it more interactive!
